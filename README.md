# Transforming and scaling data - materials
### Understand the fundamental concepts of manipulating data distributions for modelling and visualization
### By Matúš Seči (m.seci@ed.ac.uk)

**This repository contains materials relating to the tutorial published [on our website](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/tutorials/data-scaling/).**

# Tutorial Aims
1. Understand the purpose of transformations and scaling in statistical analysis.
2. Understand the underlying mathematics and use appropriate syntax and packages in R to apply both common and more advanced transformations and scaling procedures.
3. Learn how to reverse transformations and scaling to obtain estimates and predictions in the original units of measure.
4. Learn how to change the scales on the plot axes and label them appropriately.
5. Learn how to apply these concepts to real problems in ecology and environmental sciences involving data through worked examples.
